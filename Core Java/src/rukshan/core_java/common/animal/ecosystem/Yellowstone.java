/**
 * Project Requirements (Requirements Specification)
 * 1. Select an ecosystem to simulate. - CHECK
 * 		1a. The Ecosystem must be unique with regard to other classmates - CHECK
 * 		1b. The Ecosystem must be diverse enough to be able to create simulations - CHECK
 * 		1c. Take notes about the ecosystem and how it works. Include weather considerations 
 * 			food availability, seasonality, etc.
 * 2. Identify at least 5 animals to simulate in your ecosystem
 * 		2a. The animals must be chosen with regard to their interactions with each other
 * 		2b. The animals must all be active at the same time (night vs day vs twilight)
 * 		2c. Take notes about how the animals behave with regard to their species, 
 * 			predators or prey and competition with other species for scarce resources
 * 3. Tdentify at least two simulations to create
 *		3a. Each simulation must involve at least two species
 * 
 * Design Specification
 * 1.	Ecosystem
 * 		1a. EcosystemType must be unique in class.
 * 		1b. Your ecosystem may be given any name but must specify the unique EcosystemType
 * 		1c. Your ecosystem class must derive from this abstract class Ecosystem. 
 * 			The tech lead has sole responsibility for this class
 * 		1d.	Do not include a main() method. Your ecosystem must be called from outside the class
 * 2.	Animal
 * 		2a. The animal classes must derive from the Animal class in our hierarchy
 * 		2b. EcosystemType must be specified in each class
 * 		2c. Age related behaviors must be created for eating, moving and sleeping

		DESCRIPTION = "Yellowstone National Park is a nearly 3,500-sq.-mile wilderness recreation area atop a volcanic hot spot. "
				+ "Mostly in Wyoming, the park spreads into parts of Montana and Idaho too. "
				+ "Yellowstone features dramatic canyons, alpine rivers, "
				+ "lush forests, hot springs and gushing geysers, including its most famous, Old Faithful. "
				+ "It's also home to hundreds of animal species, including bears, wolves, bison, elk and antelope.";
		WEATHER = "Since most of the park lies at an elevation of 6,000 feet (1829 m) above sea level or higher, "
				+ "unpredictability characterizes Yellowstone's weather. "
				+ "Expect big temperature swings, rain, or snow during every month of the year. "
				+ "No matter when you visit, bring a warm jacket, rain gear, and lots of layers.";
